Module 10 Challenge Repo

The notebook analysis using Python and SQLAlchemy can be found in the file "climate_final.ipynb."

The Climate App using Flask can be found using the file "app.py"

## Outside research assistance:

-- I received tutoring assistance from my tutor Justin to properly replicate the given precipitation graph in the analysis. I mistakenly interpreted the plot as a bar graph when it was in fact a line graph! I opted to leave in the remnants of my original solution to demonstrate my process and show what I think was the right track, just with the incorrect graph type.

-- I also received tutoring assistance from Justin on the Climate app file to properly display a "Date not found" message if the date given for the start only endpoint was not in the database. We began working on a way to proivde an error message in the start/end endpoint, but we ran out of time after developing a way for the code to determine that the range was valid (the start date occurred before the end date). Justin offered to continue working through this idea in the future but indicated this was technically beyond the scope of the assignment and that my current iteration satisfies the challenge.
